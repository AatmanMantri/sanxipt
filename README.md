Webpage summariser
This is a pet project I started with the aim of summarising any webpage with the help of GPT. I wanted to make it a website but as it turns out it is not viable with the free account. In any case, the code works with a paid account. Just use your own credentials. Enjoy!
Let me know if someone is able to find a workaround with that.
